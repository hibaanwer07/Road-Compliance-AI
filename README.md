# ROAD COMPILANCE AI : Real-Time Helmet and Number Plate Detection using yolov8n

## 🚦 Overview

**ROAD COMPILANCE AI** is a deep learning-based computer vision project that detects motorcycle riders, classifies helmet usage (with/without), and identifies number plates in real-time from images or video feeds. Built using YOLOv8n, this project aims to enhance road safety and enable intelligent surveillance for traffic rule enforcement.

> **Goal**: Detect violations (no helmet) and extract vehicle number plates for documentation and action.
